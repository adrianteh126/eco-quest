# WIG3005 Game Development Project

## Project Description
This is a project under course WIG3005 Game Development. EcoQuest is a 2D RPG-like interactive quiz game set in a charming pixel-art village environment. The player navigates through the village, interacts with three distinct animal NPCs, and answers quiz questions to collect stars and gain knowledge on environmental awareness topics like recycling, energy conservation, and water conservation.

The village map is designed for exploration, with paths and areas to walk around, creating a sense of discovery. While there are no interactive elements besides the NPCs, the environment encourages players to wander and enjoy the scenery.

During quizzes, players have two lives. Incorrect answers result in a loss of life, and losing both lives means the quiz must be reattempted.
